## Coding Standards
Provided below are the standards that are followed while coding SnapMoji.   

### Identifiers
Identifiers are descriptive enough to minimize the need for comments.  Multi-worded identifiers separate words by the their case, where the first letter of another word is capitalized. 
* variables: variable names start with a lower-case letter and are letter-case separated ie. "twoWords"
* classes: classes start with an upper-case letter and are also letter-case separated ie. "ThreeWords"
* methods: methods follow the same naming convention as variables 
* files: files follow the same naming convention as classes

Indents in the code are 4 spaces.
