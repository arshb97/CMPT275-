# CMPT275-SnapMoji

## Project Summary

Capture your emotions with Snapmoji. With our iOS app, SnapMoji, our aim is to help
those that struggle with identifying different emotions. SnapMoji will guide these individuals
develop their emotional comprehension of close friends and family with a database that the user
can create to become more familiar with the people close to them. Studies show that those with
autism have difficulty in identifying emotions in facial expressions, especially emotions that are
similar such as anger and sadness. However, many have developed methods to help those
who struggle with identifying emotions as recognizing facial expressions can be taught.
Using SnapMoji everyday will help train these skills and improve social interactions for the user.
The user can interact with their friends and family by taking multiple pictures of them emulating
different emotions. They can also track their progress by testing their ability to identify the
emotions in the pictures that they have taken. Levels of difficulty will be included such as
identifying emotions or mental states within full or partial photos of the face. If the user cannot
identify the emotion in the picture they have taken SnapMoji will help with the identification and
let the user know what emotion is present in the image. SnapMoji is for anyone that is having
trouble differentiating emotions in facial expressions and want to work toward developing this
skill.

## About the Team Members

Every member in the team is a current SFU computer engineering student going on their third or
fourth year. They have all gained work experience through previous internships and range in
their technological skill set.

Merna Zaki
Merna’s previous experience involves an eight month
internship at CA Technologies as a Software Engineer. She
worked for the Mobile Client Team and specialized in
Android. Her preferred coding environment is C/C++ and Java
in windows or Linux.

engineer. He is comfortable applying both his hardware and
software skills that he has acquired from studying at SFU. His
preferred coding language is C/C++ and he also enjoys testing
and documentation roles.

Jiung Choi
Jiung enjoys spending his free time practicing different coding
languages, resulting in his strong ability to work with
object-oriented programming. In addition, he is comfortable
with using pointer-based data structures, and performing
manual memory management for dynamic allocation and
deallocation in C/C++.

course projects using different languages such as C/C++. He
enjoys working in windows and linux and has experience
working with MySQL.

## Coding Standards
Provided below are the standards that are followed while coding SnapMoji.   

### Identifiers
The identifiers are descriptive enough to minimize the need for comments; however, comments should still be used to explain major functions and classes.  Multi-worded identifiers separate words by the their case, where the first letter of another word is capitalized. 
* variables: variable names start with a lower-case letter and are letter-case separated ie. "twoWords"
* classes: classes start with an upper-case letter and are also letter-case separated ie. "ThreeWords"
* methods: methods follow the same naming convention as variables 
* files: files follow the same naming convention as classes
  * source code will have a header to list the programmers that worked on it, a changelog, and a list of known bugs 
Indents in the code are 4 spaces.
