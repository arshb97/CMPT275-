# CMPT275-SnapMoji

## Coding Standards
Provided below are the standards that are followed while coding SnapMoji.   

### Identifiers
The identifiers are descriptive enough to minimize the need for comments; however, comments should still be used to explain major functions and classes.  Multi-worded identifiers separate words by the their case, where the first letter of another word is capitalized. 
* variables: variable names start with a lower-case letter and are letter-case separated ie. "twoWords"
* classes: classes start with an upper-case letter and are also letter-case separated ie. "ThreeWords"
* methods: methods follow the same naming convention as variables 
* files: files follow the same naming convention as classes
  * source code will have a header to list the programmers that worked on it, a changelog, and a list of known bugs 
Indents in the code are 4 spaces.
